# STYLEGAN-CAT
Implementation of NV/Labs styleGAN on cats dataset
StyleGAN on TensorFlow
Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of StyleGAN in TensorFlow. StyleGAN is a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture that was proposed by NVIDIA researchers in 2018. StyleGAN has been used to generate high-quality images of faces, animals, and other objects.

The StyleGAN architecture is based on the GAN architecture, which consists of a generator and a discriminator. The generator generates new images, and the discriminator evaluates whether the images are real or fake. During training, the generator learns to generate images that are increasingly difficult for the discriminator to distinguish from real images.

Requirements
TensorFlow 2.0 or higher
Python 3.6 or higher
numpy
PIL
matplotlib
Getting Started
To get started, first clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stylegan-tensorflow.git
cd stylegan-tensorflow
Next, download the pre-trained model weights from the official StyleGAN repository:

mkdir models
cd models
wget https://nvlabs-fi-cdn.nvidia.com/stylegan2-ada/pretrained/ffhq.pkl
Now, you can generate new images using the pre-trained model:


import numpy as np
import PIL.Image
import dnnlib
import dnnlib.tflib as tflib

# Load pre-trained model
url = 'https://nvlabs-fi-cdn.nvidia.com/stylegan2-ada/pretrained/ffhq.pkl'
with dnnlib.util.open_url(url) as f:
    _G, _D, Gs = pickle.load(f)

# Generate random image
latents = np.random.randn(1, Gs.input_shape[1])
images = Gs.run(latents)

# Save image
PIL.Image.fromarray(images[0], 'RGB').save('example.png')
Training Your Own Models
To train your own StyleGAN models, you will need a large dataset of images. NVIDIA has released a number of datasets that are compatible with StyleGAN, including the FFHQ dataset (which consists of high-quality images of human faces) and the LSUN dataset (which consists of images of various indoor and outdoor scenes).

Once you have a dataset, you can train a StyleGAN model using the run_training.py script:

python run_training.py --data_dir=~/datasets/mydataset --config=config-f --metrics=none
This will start the training process using the config-f configuration file, which is suitable for high-quality image synthesis. You can modify the configuration file to adjust the hyperparameters of the model.

Conclusion
StyleGAN is a powerful tool for generating high-quality images. With this repository, you can experiment with pre-trained models or train your own models using TensorFlow. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
